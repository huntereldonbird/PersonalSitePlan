      </h2>

      <h3>The Website Idea</h3>
      <p>
        Originally, we wanted a system to compare wins and losses, so we started keeping track of our games to compete with each other over a larger period of time and in different games. So we have a Google doc with a large data set of games and statistics, but the problem is that it is impossible to quickly figure out what you are looking for. The information is well organized, it is just sometimes WAY too much information to look through. So my website will work like the MLB or any other sports league website where it will quickly show recent games and player stats. It will let us all see the current ranking for each major game that we play, and the scheduled time and dates. I plan on doing this by learning some PHP and maybe trying to use that as the database, failing that, using JavaScript to have it function.

      </p>
      
      <p>Images for the Home Page</p>
        <img src="img/party.jpg" alt="A part of all of us back in 2023" width="500">
        <p>One of our events took so long that we actually ended up moving to a friends</p>
        <img src="img/Eclipse.jpg" alt="The Eclipse that happened during one of our events" width="500">
        <p>Really cool moment where during one of our events, we took time to go outside and check out the solar Eclipse that happened.</p>


        <p>Maybe including other cool things that happen during out event</p>
      </ul>



      </ul>
      <h3>Player Ranking Page</h3>
      <p>
        This part of the webpage is focused on showing player rankings. I actually found this cool idea from the MLB website about having player cards and adding the last 3 games they participated in, comparing their overall stats, and then ranking them. This will give the user a quick way to not only how they rank but the overall positions of different players and their teams.
      </p>

      <p>

       I wanted to include photos of some of the people who play in the tournemants. Almost like a sports league so that we can keep track of everything. here are some examples of player profiles that we could use( also jsut some of the poeple who I work with).

      </p>


      <p>Images for the Player Ranking</p>
        <img src="img/Eldon.jpg" alt="This is the guy who sets up the whole events" width="500">

        <p> This is Luke, the guy who actually made the entire game night. I thought that if I was going to add photos of the people running the events, I should make them funny</p>
        <img src="img/Ashley.jpg" alt="Little Mario Guy" width="500">

      <p> This is Ashley, she is in charge of working with the Texas Tech campus staff so that we can run our events in person</p>


      <p>I want to include other photos of players maybe like a baseball card or something so that we can keep track.</p>



      <h3>Modding Info Section</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to include another page about our game's modding situation. We have had a lot of problems keeping track of which mod and “playset” we are going to be using, and we end up wasting way too much time when a few players can't figure it out quickly. I thought that if we had a quick way to access the link in the same place that you look at the other stats, that would make it a little more obvious where to download it and how to get in the game quicker. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The second issue I wanted to solve was the disconnect between the mods and the players. We have a lot of information already added to a spreadsheet online that anyone can look at. This spreadsheet tells you All of the additional features and in-game statistics that are added by our mods. So by going through them, you can form a more complex strategy around newly changed In-game statistics. I wanted to add this because I have personal experience as the person who makes the mods for our Stellaris campaigns. Since I make the mod and add all the info into the spreadsheet, I usually have an advantage when I’m playing because I’m more comfortable with the new changes. Because I know not everyone looks through those because they can sometimes be hard to find, I wanted to put them somewhere where they can quickly referenced.
      </p>

        <p> The place that we decided to occupy thanks to the Texas Tech campus. This is the private library room and it holds about 26 people (there is much more space on the left).</p>


        <p>I want to include other informaiton here as well, like locations...</p>

      </ul>

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The landing page for everyone. A quick overview of information that almost anyone would need like the scheudle, or current winners, or ongoing games and streams.

      <p>         
        A place to find the current player ranking and everything relating to your own stats and position. It will hav ehte included ranks, and also things like win loss %.
