        DISCLAIMER <br>

        Becuase of the nature of my website, there arent many photos that I needed. So I mostly used funny photos and other things that I would personally include in the website, even if only because they are funny. I have also been given permision from those in the photos that I can include them
      </p>

      <h3>The Website Idea</h3>
      <p>
        Originally, we wanted a system to compare wins and losses, so we started keeping track of our games to compete with each other over a larger period of time and in different games. So we have a Google doc with a large data set of games and statistics, but the problem is that it is impossible to quickly figure out what you are looking for. The information is well organized, it is just sometimes WAY too much information to look through. So my website will work like the MLB or any other sports league website where it will quickly show recent games and player stats. It will let us all see the current ranking for each major game that we play, and the scheduled time and dates. I plan on doing this by learning some PHP and maybe trying to use that as the database, failing that, using JavaScript to have it function.

      </ul>
      <h3>Player Ranking Page</h3>
      <p>
        This part of the webpage is focused on showing player rankings. I actually found this cool idea from the MLB website about having player cards and adding the last 3 games they participated in, comparing their overall stats, and then ranking them. This will give the user a quick way to not only how they rank but the overall positions of different players and their teams.
      </p>

      <p>

        I also want another section of the website that instead of being a quick reference ranking system, is the actual specific statistics a player has. Such as their win percentages in specific games, ending scores, individual game positions, time in the game, etc. I just think that these would be cool to see and would make those really dumb arguments that we sometimes have really easy to look up and reference.

      </ul>
      <h3>Modding Info Section</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to include another page about our game's modding situation. We have had a lot of problems keeping track of which mod and “playset” we are going to be using, and we end up wasting way too much time when a few players can't figure it out quickly. I thought that if we had a quick way to access the link in the same place that you look at the other stats, that would make it a little more obvious where to download it and how to get in the game quicker. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The second issue I wanted to solve was the disconnect between the mods and the players. We have a lot of information already added to a spreadsheet online that anyone can look at. This spreadsheet tells you All of the additional features and in-game statistics that are added by our mods. So by going through them, you can form a more complex strategy around newly changed In-game statistics. I wanted to add this because I have personal experience as the person who makes the mods for our Stellaris campaigns. Since I make the mod and add all the info into the spreadsheet, I usually have an advantage when I’m playing because I’m more comfortable with the new changes. Because I know not everyone looks through those because they can sometimes be hard to find, I wanted to put them somewhere where they can quickly referenced.
